Example on how to retrieve data from twitter and do a topic model analysis on it.

This is an example on how to fit some topic models on data retrieved from twitter. It is heavily based on the twitteR package in R.  

In order to 'do it yourself' you need access to the twitter API and for that you need to create an twitter app (with your twitter account). 
For that go to apps.twitter.com.  

The fi_stopwords.Rda file includes finnish stopwords that are retrieved from http://www.nettiapina.fi/finnish-stopword-list/ 
with some manual additions.
